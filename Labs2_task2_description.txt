After pushing button time is being measured until user will realse button. 
Time difference is calculated by current time and measured in pushing button moment.

diftime = millis(); // pushing button 1 step 
diftime =  millis()-diftime; // realsing 

Time has to be calculated from miliseconds to hours, minutes, seconds and then miliseconds

 hours = diftime/(1000*60*60); 
      diftime-=1000*60*60*hours;
      
      minutes = diftime/(1000*60); 
      diftime-=1000*60*minutes;
      
      seconds = diftime/1000; 
      diftime-=1000*minutes;
      
Time has to be converted in readable structure for user
It is used 00:00:00:0000 HH:mm:ss:msmsmsms
where HH-hours, mm-minutes, ss-seconds, ms-miliseconds 
In order to convert it I have to count if it's lesser or bigger than 10 (one digit more)
      Serial.print(hours);
      if(hours<10) Serial.print('0');
      Serial.print(':');
      Serial.print(minutes);
      if(minutes<10) Serial.print('0');
      Serial.print(':');
      Serial.print(seconds);
      if(seconds<10) Serial.print('0');

      Serial.print(':');
      Serial.println(diftime);
