first task is extended with priting functions: 

  Serial.print(voltage); 
  Serial.print(",");//seperator another version is '/t' although here only ',' works
  Serial.print(backlight);
  Serial.println("");
  
which represents: 
voltage,backlight
voltage2,backlight2 ... 

Embedded plotter interprets serial prints into chart and it shows from 0 V to 5 V
