Backlight state turns off and turns on backlight in lcd with lcd.backlight()/lcd.noBacklight() functions
it is controlled by button. Every iteration in loop analog value of potentiometr is read and send to
lcd. data is prepared using sprintf function, where there is voltage and adc put
sprintf(data, "V=%d.%02d ADC=%d", (int)voltage, (int)(voltage*100)%100, adc); 
voltage is calculated using provided formula: (adc*5)/1024.0.
