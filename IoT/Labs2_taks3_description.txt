Algorithm: 
There’s buffer which holds up to 10 lines of text.
User adds next line using function writeAndGoNext(line, length, linePositon) 
where linePosition means position in buffer. User can see up two lines
in one moment therefore cursorsLine is set and changed with buttons going
from 0 up to 10. If cursorLine is set to 2 users sees 2nd and 3rd line of buffer.
Autoscroll: Lines could extend 16 characters which is maximum for screen 16x2
in order to see whole text text scrolls from right to left and when it ends 
it starts from beginning. To achieve described functionality every iteration
text is cut off from the left to 16 positions making it able to fit into screen
size: Let take example: „Internet of Things is fun’ 

1 iteration: 
Internet of Things
2 iteration: 
nternet of Things 
3 iteration: 
ternet of Things i
4 iteration: 
ernet of Things is
5 iteration: 
rnet of Things is f
6 iteration: 
net of Things is fu
6 iteration: 
et of Things is fun
7 iteration: 
Internet of Things
