There is counter which we can increment and decrement by one. It is done using buttons which we had to prepare 
to remove false alarm clicks which we make by delay and check if state hasn't changed within the time (remove vibration effect)
We have three option: 
- increment counter
- decrement counter 
- blink led <counter_state> times 
Over itreation of loop only one can happen due to use else if statement
if(button1&&button2)
  //increment
else if(button2)
 //decrement
else if(button1)
 //blink several times
